##Django Calculator App

This is a calculator application built using the Django web framework. The app allows users to perform arithmetic operations.

The front-end of the application is built using HTML. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input the equation to the entry. The result is displayed immediately after the calculation is performed.

The back-end of the application is built using Django. It handles the calculation logic using "eval" function in python and sends the result back to the front-end.

This application is useful for anyone who needs a simple calculator for arithmetic operations. It demonstrates how to build a basic web application with Django and can be used as a starting point for developing more complex calculator applications.
